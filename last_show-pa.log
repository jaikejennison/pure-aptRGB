[01;31m[KDescription[m[K: master-of-masters for salt, the distributed remote execution system
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to administer
 servers in a fast and efficient way. 
 
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers. This means
 systems can be easily managed, but data can also be easily gathered.  Quick
 introspection into running systems becomes a reality. 
 
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote system.
 Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt state system uses salt state
 files to define the state a server needs to be in. 
 
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt addresses the
 backbone of cloud and data center management. 
 
 This particular package provides the master of masters for salt - it enables
 the management of multiple masters at a time.
